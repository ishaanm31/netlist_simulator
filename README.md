# Netlist Simulator

## Overview

The Netlist Simulator is a powerful tool designed for parsing and simulating digital circuits based on a netlist description. It consists of several core components:

- A parser to read and understand netlist files.
- A simulator to evaluate the behavior of logic gates.
- A mechanism to manage wire connections and signals.

This project is ideal for those looking to analyze digital circuits or verify logical correctness based on a netlist description.

## Prerequisites

To build and run the Netlist Simulator, ensure you have the following installed:

- **CMake** (version 3.10 or higher)
- **C++17 compatible compiler** (e.g., GCC, Clang, or MSVC)
